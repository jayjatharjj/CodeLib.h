 		Execution

Preprocessing - Using a Preprocessor program to convert C source code in expanded source code. "#includes" and "#defines" statements will be processed and replaced actually source codes in this step.

Compilation - Using a Compiler program to convert C expanded source to assembly source code.

Assembly - Using a Assembler program to convert assembly source code to object code.


Linking - Using a Linker program to convert object code to executable code. Multiple units of object codes are linked to together in this step.

Loading - Using a Loader program to load the executable code into CPU for execution.
