The C preprocessor is a micro processor that is used by compiler to transform your code before compilation. It is called micro preprocessor because it allows us to add macros.
Macro in C programming is known as the piece of code defined with the help of the #define directive. Macros in C are very useful at multiple places to replace the piece of code with a single value of the macro. Macros have multiple types and there are some predefined macros as well.
